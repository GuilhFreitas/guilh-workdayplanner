# Work Day Scheduler

<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
<br />

This is a simple workday scheduler, built using Bootstrap and the Javascript jquery and Moment libraries. It keeps track of events for a typical 9 to 5 workday. An event can be assigned to each hour and saved, after which it will persist between refreshes. Time blocks are color coded according to the current time, and the current day is displayed at the top of the page.
